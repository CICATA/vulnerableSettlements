# Vulnerable Settlements

One of the challenges in the fight against poverty is the precise localization and assessment of the  sprawl of vulnerable communities. This is traditionally accomplished using nation-wide census exercises, a burdensome process that  requires field visits by trained personnel. Unfortunately, censuses are conducted only sporadically (e.g., every ten years in Mexico), which makes it difficult or impossible to track the short-term effect of policies to fight poverty. In practice, poverty assessment is  carried out through extrapolations, sampling,  indirect indicators, and lately using satellite images. In this research, we propose to build a system that maps  images from  satellite surveys with data captured in the field by means of machine learning schemes. Given images of the area of interest, the system extracts features related to well-being of the communities considered. This strategy permits a quick assessment of the degree of vulnerability of new or changing community sprawls, providing quantitative information that can be used to evaluate the effect of governmental policies and socio-economical factors.
